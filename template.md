# How I Work - Kenny Luo

## 1. My Role and Responsibilities
- Brief description of your position
  As a QA Developer, my job is to perform testing on every release version IBM Concert to catch and report bugs that the development team may have missed when developing new   
  features. Occasionally I assist developers with providing specific environments of the application as they debug Sev 1 issues. 
- Key areas of focus and primary responsibilities
  have working knowledge of the features of IBM Concert and keep up to date with new features that are coming in from development
  have the knowledge on how to properly test each feature 
- How my role contributes to the company's mission
  my role contributes to the companyâ€™s mission by catching and reporting bugs in the application before the bugs are discovered by the customer. If bugs/issues were raised by the 
  customer, then that would be a poor customers experience. Thought this does happen sometimes, my job is to reduce this as much as possible. 
## 2. My Core Values
- List 3-5 core values that guide your work and decision-making
  Priority
  Importance 
- Brief explanation of how these values manifest in your daily work

   to make understand what the priorities are for my work items. 
## 3. Communication Preferences

 slack or message my phone
